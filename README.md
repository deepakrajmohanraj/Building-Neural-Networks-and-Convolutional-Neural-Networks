# Building Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks

This assignment focuses on building fully connected neural networks (NN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). It consists of four parts where we practice dealing with various datasets and implement, train, and adjust neural networks. The first part consists of performing data analysis and building a basic NN. In the second part, we learn how to optimize and improve our NN using various techniques. In the third part, we will implement a basic CNN and apply optimization and data augmentation techniques in the fourth part.
